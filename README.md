This is an awesome app that lets you know what movies are playing in your area, and store them in your account. You can create an account using Facebook, or just your email.

## Technologies Used

I used the devise gem to set up the sign in feature. And the back end of this application is Ruby on Rails. and the front-end is JQuery.



## Instructions

1. Download the zip file.
2. Run bundle install.
3. And start the rails server.
